TODO: Describe problem / current situation

 * dots_generated (runtime and sdk)
 * lock files
 * log files
 * crash_dumps
 * dope files
 * shared memory files

== Dots Generated

The goal is to make the building of the separate dots_generated dlls (or shared libraries, but I'll write dll, since it is shorter) into more like building a normal dll. Currently all dlls are rebuilt every time dobmake is run, which is a waste of time for most of the dou files.
